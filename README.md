# Llanite engine
A customised game engine specifically built for flexibility, development speed and ease of use.

## Core libraries:
* [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs/)
* [Winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit)
* [Shipyard](https://github.com/leudz/shipyard)
* [Pollster](https://docs.rs/pollster/latest/pollster/)

## Project focus:
Creating a new game engine that should implement features that big time engines are missing out, such as live collaboration whilst still being basic, fast, and easy to use.

## Why?
50%: passion project and for learning,
50%: I noticed big engines were missing out features that I wanted and had interfaces that felt too bloated to me and too frustrating to use, this is why I started working on this game engine.

## Support
The best support that you can give me is through issues or pull requests to help me get this engine running as quick as possible

## Scripting
Plans for scripting are Rust DLLs and embedded LuaJIT. Another choice could be Rhai if performance benefits are possible (currently it seems to be far too slow on first impressions).
