# TODO list

## High priority
* [ ] - Fully install Bevy ECS into the engine instead of Shipyard
* [ ] - Parse vertex buffer data between CPU (Bevy ECS) and the GPU.
* [ ] - Allow storing textures and rendering them to models/shapes.

## Low priority
* [ ] - Allow custom vertices to be pushed into the engine.
* [ ] - Read RON file into engine? (CBOR?)

# Done
* [x] - Use `include_str!` macro to bring backup shader in at compile time.
